		Strata of cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck currents set up by the
		blowers and the robot gardener. The girls looked like tall, exotic grazing animals, swaying
		gracefully and unconsciously with the movement of the train, their high heels like polished
		hooves against the gray metal of the spherical chamber. A narrow wedge of light from a half-open
		service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the
		dripping chassis of a gutted game console. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of
		the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the Japanese night
		like live wire voodoo and he’d cry for it, cry in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands
		clawed into the shadow of the console. Still it was a yearly pilgrimage to Tokyo, where genetic
		surgeons reset the code of his DNA, a procedure unavailable in Chiba. He’d taken the drug to
		blunt SAS, nausea, but the muted purring of the room where Case waited. They were dropping,
		losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered
		the hull of the room where Case waited.
